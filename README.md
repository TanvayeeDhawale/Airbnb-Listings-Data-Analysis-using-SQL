# Airbnb listings Data Analysis using SQL

Part of the SQL for Data Science course at CoRise. This project aims to apply SQL commands to help with customer support for the Airbnb launch in Sydney in various scenarios that a General Manager would face.

## Dataset
For this project, I've used the Airbnb Listings in Sydney dataset. 
As the General manager for the Sydney area at Airbnb, I want to know more about the different listings of houses my team has onboarded. 
I have access to information regarding the listings, neighbourhoods, reviews, and calendar. Each of these have their own separate table.
